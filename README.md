# Iceberg-detection-in-Satellite-Images

The main objective of this Project is develop methods for detecting icebergs using satellite radar data and high-resolution imagery in the visible spectral range.
Satellite monitoring systems for dangerous glaciers, such as glaciers in the Arctic sea represent a threat to the safety of navigation and economic activity on the Arctic shelf.
